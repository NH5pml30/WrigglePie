# ITMO CT Labs and Homeworks

(Except for C++ course, those have dedicated repos)

Almost all C++ projects probably need MSVC with C++17 or C++20

## Translation Methods Labs
- perl regex lab
- top-down hand-written parser
- use of automatic parser generators (alex + happy)
- LALR(1) bottom-up parser (and very simple regex lexer) generator

## Algorithms and Data Structures, Probability Theory & Programming
Tasks are in .pdf or .md files

## Discrete Maths
No task descriptions for now...
Some may be found archived [here](http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://neerc.ifmo.ru/teaching/dm*) or [here](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nerc.itmo.ru/teaching/dm*)

## Linear Algebra
Tasks are probably lost forever
